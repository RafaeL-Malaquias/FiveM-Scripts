## 📋 Function Documentation

Example of how I organize my code:

> [!TIP]
> **Example Function:** `CheckPlayerInventory()`
> - **Purpose:** Checks if the player has the required item before starting the animation.
> - **Compatibility:** Automatically toggles between `QBCore.Functions.GetPlayerData` and `vRP.getInventoryItem`.
