## 📋 Function Documentation

Example of how I organize my code to ensure compatibility:

> [!TIP]
> **Example Function:** `CheckPlayerInventory()`
> - **Purpose:** Checks if the player has the required item before starting an action or animation.
> - **Compatibility:** Automatically toggles between `xPlayer.getInventoryItem` (ESX) and `vRP.getInventoryItemAmount` (vRP).
